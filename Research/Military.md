## Military

  * It is probably fair to say that Portuguese cyber and code defences is as good as Portuguese current military status
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Air_Force
    * Question why doesn't Portugal needs F-16?
    * 2.138,8 billion euros budget (2014)

  * The problem is that the cyber attackers that will hit Portugal are as sophisticated as the best physical military attackers (and armies)
    * Imagine the PT army against the UK, France or Russia (never mind the US or China)
    * note how even the best companies and security agencies in the world are not able to detect and mitigate most attacker
      * recent DDoS attacks and zero-days exploits
        * https://twitter.com/macbroadcast/status/791837377186725888 (fun video of what ddos attack feels like)
  * Important question is _"Do we want to do something about it, or be hit by the cross-fire?"_
      * Note that as attackers get more sophisticated they will gravitate to counties/companies with weaker defences (since they take longer with ramp up)
      * Massive cyber/app security skills shortage today

 * What about using 10% of the military budget to fund these?
