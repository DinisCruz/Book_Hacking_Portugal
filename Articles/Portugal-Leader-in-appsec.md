## Best in world

Just as in football, where Portugal is one of the best teams in the world (add pic of Euro 2016 win and PT FIFA ranking), Portugal needs to be one of the best in the world in Coding and Cyber/App Security.

PT is currently 8th in the [Fifa world ranking](http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/associations/association=por/men/index.html)


### Portugal as a Leader in AppSec

We are entering the age of availability (vs Age of Ownership). Technology and secure coding is what will make this happen


Portugal could be a leader in AppSec. Portugal has a rich history of providing leading innovators and ground-breaking researchers in navigation, in maritime research, and exploration. Portugal must build on its history of innovation and achievement, and become a world leader in coding. 

Portuguese researchers are highly innovative. They are following this great history of leading important change and discovery.

Code becomes more and more important. Code controls Portugal, and so software controls Portugal. The problem is, Portugal controls very little of the software it uses, and I think it is time for Portugal to take control of the software. I think this should be a strategic objective of both Portuguese companies and the Portuguese government.

Of course, you can replace Portugal with any other country in the world, especially any European country. But I am Portuguese, so I have a soft spot for Portugal, and I know that Portugal has exceptional talent, exceptional AppSec people who could make this happen. What we need is focus and determination.

We now need the digital equivalent of the great products, including food, created in Portugal, and we need to expand the market of those products. Portugal should not compete on cheap labor, but on the following resources:
      * advanced technology
      * people
      * skills
      * infrastructure
      * ability to deliver
      * not the 'sweat-house', but the 'power-house'
      
## Key objectives to encourage and foment the PT software industry
* "Made in Portugal/Code made in Portugal" is the key for PT economy (and Europe's sustainability)
* Good software development teams (from developers to management) are one of the most important assets of a company and country. They are the ones who add value. They create reality, and ultimately they control your lives.

## PT needs to export engineers
Everyone that leaves Portugal brings Portugal with them. They become an ambassador for Portugal, and, assuming they are easy to buy from abroad, they become a consumer of PT products. Many of them have connections with Portuguese companies, and could bring jobs back to Portugal in the long run.  Everyone that leaves Portugal and returns later, brings the skills and experience learned abroad with them. 

Portugal and Europe need diversity and indigenous activities/industry, for their futures. 
In Europe, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten "Why XYZ was done and what was its objective".

The next generation of manufacturing is going to be local (to a country, city, company, even a house). This is the Age of Sustainability.  PT needs to be technologically independent and sustainable. 
 
Amazon is a great model for PT (Shopping, AWS, logistics). How many senior and experienced Amazon ex-employees work in PT Gov and technology initiatives?

### What is the future of Portugal?
  * to be a garden for Europe, a holiday destination?
  * to be the [next tech capital](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/lisbon-web-summit-sun-surf-cheap-rents-tech-capital) of _'sun, surf and low rents'?_
  * to be a Powerhouse of Technology that inspires and leads the world in secure coding?
  * the CPLP (Comunidade dos Países de Língua Portuguesa - Community of the Portuguese Speaking Countries) is a massive opportunity and asset (embrace, educate, market, and secure them)
  
The Software, InfoSec and Hacking community has a strong ethical foundation, based on the following qualities:
  * sharing
  * respect
  * friendship
  * trust
  * non-discrimination
  * humanity and companionship

We want to inspire the next generation with these values. To do this, we need to provide an alternative narrative to the current mainstream narrative of 'lies', 'non-experts-welcome' and 'infotainment'.

  * "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." (see http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/11/18/great-minds)
  
* But, our alternative also has strong qualities, namely:
  * business/commercial understanding
  * money generation capabilities (outside of the 'proprietary and lock-in' business models)
  * understanding that profit is good and healthy

* story of the 'small coffee spoons' that are used in PT for espresso, and should be easy to find in the UK, but I can't find them
* I want to be able to buy 'Oranges from the Algarve' and get them delivered to London

  * for PT it says _"Portugal - rate -	graduating high school"_
 We can do better than that; we should be world leaders in software, craftsmanship, cyber security, secure coding, and DevOps. 

### Future of code
* If you are developing code today, and you are not thinking in terms of:
  * CI automation
  * everything is code (including CI scripts, firewall rules, app's authentication models)
  * graphs
  * containers (aka Docker)
  * version control for data storage (aka Git)
  * AI and machine learning
  * cloud (aka AWS, Azure, Rackspace)
  * serverless code (aka AWS lambda)
  * liquid code, message queues, self-defending applications

  .... you are already legacy (code), because all these are the future.
