## PHS - Portuguese Hacking Service

In the past Portugal had a Military Service called 'Servico Militar Obrigatorio'. We should update this service to the 21st Century and make it a Hacking Service for 15 to 21 year olds, with the following mission objectives:

* hack everything that is plugged-in to Portugal's network
* hack companies with public bug-bounties
* code-review Open Source code developed in Portugal
* code-review code marked as 'strategic interest for Portugal' (i.e. widely used by Portuguese companies and mission critical for them)
* contribute to Open Source projects with patches and fixes
* help SMEs with their digital security and DevOps

### Military

It is probably fair to say that Portuguese cyber and code defenses are as good as Portugal's current military status.

The problem is that the cyber attackers who will hit Portugal are as sophisticated as the best soldiers, and armies.

Imagine the Portuguese army against the UK, France or Russia, not to mention the US or China.

Note how even the best companies and security agencies in the world are not able to detect and mitigate most attacks, as evidenced by recent DDoS attacks and zero-days exploits. The following video gives a humorous idea of what a DDoS attack feels like.

### Why do we have F16s?

Why does Portugal need an offensive air force? I understand the need to have a civil air-force, to combat fires or for border patrols, but an offensive air force, with F16s? What is the 'war scenario' where that makes sense?

The way you fight an airborne battle in the 21st century is by hacking into the offensive planes/drones via their communication channels. The novel *Ghost Fleet* (Singer & Cole, 2015) imagines the next, virtual, world war.

The military budget for Portugal in 2014 was just over €2.1 billion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Armed_Forces). I would argue that the government should allocate 10% of the current military budget to fund investment in cyber/app security, and the huge skills shortage in this area.

### Hit by the crossfire

The important question is _"Do we want to do something about this, or be hit by the cross-fire?"_ If we do not consider this question, and address the huge skills shortage in cyber/app security that exists in Portugal, we will pay a heavy price.

As attackers become more sophisticated, they will gravitate to countries and companies with weaker defenses, since these take longer to ramp up their security when an attack occurs.


### Portuguese hackathon league

In the same way that we have a national football league, Portugal should organize and host regular [Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon), as part of a new, national, hackathon league.

The Portuguese hacking teams should go to DefCon, and they should be sponsored by Portuguese government and business. These teams should be a source of national pride.     

The best way to learn is to solve a problem from a variety of angles, using a variety of technologies.

### Great source of talent  

Everyone should learn to hack, including children, professionals who want to change their careers, and unemployed people. These great sources of talent should be utilized for the benefit of Portugal. Two groups that should also be taught to hack are convicted criminals and retired people. 

#### Convicted criminals
Teaching convicted criminals to hack would make good use of their skills. It would give them an alternative career to crime, and it would show them a way to make money legally. They would learn a more ethical approach to work, and they would learn the value of collaborating.

Most criminals who find themselves in prison do so from bad choices or unfortunate events, and many of them deserve a chance at a better life.

#### Retired people
We lose a lot by not using the expertise of retired people, and by not learning from them. In the past, older people were the wise ones, and respected for their knowledge and experience.
They are engineers, doctors, programmers, teachers, accountants, architects, parents, etc.
People grow old, not because of age, but because they stop being mentally and physically active.

### Working together

In the world of technology or hacking, it is okay to have teams made up of representatives from the following groups:
 * 16 year olds
 * graduates
 * retired people
 * convicted criminals
 * a dog (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)
 * a professional

If they are capable, can work together, respect each other, and deliver on their tasks, they will succeed.
